# Basic Evaluator

This project is a rewrite, using Java and ANTLR, of the **Basic Evaluator** 
presented in Chapter 1 of the book **Programming Languages: An Interpreter-Based 
Approach (PLAIBA)**, by Samuel N. Kamin, originally written in ISO Pascal.

The following tools were used in the implementation:
- JetBrains IntelliJ IDEA 2021.3.1
- Oracle Java 17
- ANTLR 4.9.3
- Ubuntu Linux 21.10

The project was configured using the following libraries:
- Oracle Java 17 SDK
- antlr-4.9.3-complete.jar

The source code and grammar for the project is located in the **src** folder.
When the project is compiled from IntelliJ, the output .class files are located
in the **out/production/BasicEvaluator** folder.
